		<h2>Return Policy</h2>
		<p>
			Vanbed offers a 7 day return policy for products we sell directly. If something goes wrong with an eligible product and you notify us within 7 days of receiving the item, we will help you to reach a satisfactory resolution such as a return for replacement, exchange, or refund.<br/><br/>

			After 7 days, our return policy expires and refunds/returns/exchanges are no longer covered. However, if you are dissatisfied with an item for any reason and the return policy has expired, you can still contact us and we will try to help if we can.<br/><br/>

			If the product has a manufacturerâ€™s warranty that is still active after the return time frame has elapsed, the buyer should contact the manufacturer directly.<br/><br/>

			For change requests on eligible items which are not defective, you will be entitled to a replacement, exchange or a voucher refund.
